# zebraCapacitor
Capacitor plugin for Zebra printers (ios and android)

## Limitations
Currently the iOS implementation is empty... but it will be implemented soon.
Also, the Android implementation is not yet tested and likely missing important things.
Also this is built using the alpha version of Capacitor

## But
I do intend to develop and support an app that uses this plugin, so this will eventually be completed and working (at least with for the printers I have access to test with).
